Pages and Screens: Next 9

Main Screen: The 9-Grid Generator

Purpose: To provide a single interface for uploading inspiration, generating content, and curating the final 3x3 grid.

Core Elements:

Inspiration Panel: Area for users to upload and view the active Style Reference Image.

3x3 Grid Display: The main canvas where up to 9 generated or selected images are displayed.

Status/Vibe Indicator: A small area showing the currently analyzed "Core Vibe" (e.g., "Minimalist 80s Cyberpunk").

User Actions:

Primary action: Upload a new Style Reference Image (triggers a style reset).

Secondary action: Click "Generate My Next 9" (initiates generation/regeneration).

Optional: Secondary action if critical: Click "Regenerate Unselected" (refines unselected slots based on current Vibe).

Onboarding
