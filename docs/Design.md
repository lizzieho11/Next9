Critical Design Questions

Before I can complete the design specs, I need:

Primary Color: What color represents your brand/app?

Accent Color: What color for buttons/highlights?

Font Vibe: Should text be rounded/friendly, sharp/modern, or classic/readable?

Please provide these, and I'll complete the design tokens.

Design Specs (to be completed)

The design uses a dark, rich background contrasted with a warm accent to emphasize the visual content.

Color Palette

Primary Color (Background/Dark): #522727 (Deep Maroon) - Used for primary dark backgrounds and containers.

Accent Color (Highlight): #B57750 (Muted Gold/Bronze) - Used for the main "Generate" button, image selection rings, and branding elements.

Text Color (Light): #E5E7EB (Light Gray) - Used for all main text for contrast against the dark background.

Typography

Font Family: Google Sans - Provides a modern, clean, and highly legible geometric look.

Usage: Used across all headings and body text for a unified, modern feel.

Spacing & Layout

Grid Layout: The 3x3 image grid is the central element, ensuring equal focus on all visual suggestions.

Rounded Corners: Use large, consistent rounded corners on all containers, buttons, and images to enhance the curated, "modern" tone.
